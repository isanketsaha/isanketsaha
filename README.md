 (Fullstack Developer). A Learn-IT-All type of a person, an OPEN SOURCE Lover, a Digital NOMAD, and an individual driven by PASSION. 

 I am passionate about the future of technology and it's endless possibilities. Today, I am working to see this happen.
 I innovate, I solve problems and I use technology to make life better. It's the spark of technology that lights up the life in me. 
 I am always seeking opportunities to work and upgrade myself, as well as giving back to the community especially with young and passionate 
 individuals in the technology space and all round space. I'm presently expanding my experience in the distributed system and microservices architecture.
 As an individual, I'm self-confident, creative, funny and naturally passionate. I'm a forward thinker, which others may find inspiring when working as 
 a team.
